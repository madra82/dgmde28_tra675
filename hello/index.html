        <h2>Background Info</h2>
        <p>My name is Trudy. I live on the Gulf Coast of Florida but I grew up in Ireland and I also lived in London before moving to the US in 2017.  I lived in New York and Chicago before moving to Florida.</p>
        <p>I am not currently pursuing any degree or certificate.  I have worked as a tax attorney for over 15 years.  In 2020, possibly as part of some kind of mid-life crisis (!), I started picking up some courses at Harvard Extension.  I started with literature and philosophy courses as I have always been interested in these subjects but, last semester, I decided to try Fundamentals of Website Development.  This caught my interest for a couple of reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I would like to start a website to track the progress of our home building project; and</li>
          <li>I have changed course slightly at work and I am now focused on developing tax technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although we are using graph technology at work, we are using a single page web-application to access the graph and much of the background relies on html and JavaScript.  While my role is more focused on the tax law underlying the application, I am more and more interested in what is going on behind the scenes.  Fundamentals of Website Development has already proven helpful at work and I am excited to learn a bit more.</p>
